        <h4>Public Short Term Parking</h4>
        <strong>
          Will there be public short term parking available, and how will this operate?
        </strong>

        <ul>
          <li>
            ICL will make available public short term parking, for visitors of Automated Precinct
            tenants, and the hospitality facilities within the Precinct.
          </li>
          <li>
            ICL will, subject to the carpark rules, ensure there is sufficient parking available for
            its permanent Lessee tenants.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The rates for public short term parking will be as shown on the Tariff Board on entry to
          the carpark. The initial short term rate is $3.00 for the first hour (or part thereof),
          and $1.50 per 30 minute period thereafter. A maximum rate of $14.00 per day applies. ICL
          reserves the right to change short term parking rates as supply and demand changes.
        </p>
